# Alexa-Lambda-Kegbot
Alexa-Lambda-Kegbot is an Alexa Skill for communication with your Kegbot. Currently is supports the following:
* What's on tap?
* How much is left?

For a more home friendly setup, maybe the alexa-app version is better: [alexa-app-kegbot](https://github.com/patfreeman/alexa-app-kegbot)
